**An example iOS application that demonstrates to how to implement a Protocol-based Model-View-ViewModel architecture**

## What does it do?

Two things: It's an example of how to implement a Protocol-based Model-View-ViewModel architecture and it also demonstrates
how to programmatically set Auto-Layout constraints to achieve variable height UITableViewCells. The result is some very clean code, 
in my opinion.
